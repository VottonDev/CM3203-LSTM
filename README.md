# CM3203 Cardiff University Dissertation

This is the repository for my dissertation project for my BSc Computer Science degree at Cardiff University. The project is a machine learning algorithm written in Python from scratch to predict the future stock price of a company using the LSTM algorithm.

## Directory structure
```api``` - Contains the API code for the web application and fetching the stock data.

```docker``` - Contains the Dockerfile for running the web application and API in Docker containers.

```ml-python``` - Contains the LSTM algorithm written in Python from scratch.

```ml-others``` - Contains other machine learning algorithms written in Python and TypeScript that utilise pre-existing machine learning libraries to compare the performance of the algorithms.

```web``` - Contains the web application code that utilises the API to display the stock data and predictions.

```report``` - Contains the PDF for the dissertation report.
